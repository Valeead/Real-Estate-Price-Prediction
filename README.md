In this project i learned how to create a real estate price prediction website step by step. 
Using the banglore housing pricing dataset from kaggle.com, we will first create a model using sklearn and linear regression.
The next step is to create a flask server in Python that uses the stored model to serve http requests.
The third component is a website developed in html, CSS, and javascript that allows users to input information such as square footage, bedrooms, and so on, and then calls a Python Flask server to receive the estimated price.
Almost all data science techniques, including as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, and k fold cross validation, will be covered throughout model building.
